                Humans are born with more than enough potential to fulfil their unique purpose in life, yet so few do.
                Most people merely exist rather than truly live, never experiencing the joy and satisfaction of a life well-lived.
                <br><br>
                I understand the power of limiting circumstances and beliefs. Move to be More exists to help individuals realise that they are more than how they see themselves, more than their faults, and more than their limits.
                To help people find their direction, keep moving forward and keep becoming more.
                <br><br>
                So that each and every person can claim their rightful place in a world that needs them.
