                    Because I have over two decades of experience navigating workplace dynamics as a first-time manager, middle manager, senior manager and several in-between kind of manager roles.
                    <br><br>
                    Oh, and specialist / subject matter expert or center of excellence roles. Some of them were a breeze, and some of them were, let’s say, in hindsight, my precious teaching experiences.
                    <br><br>
                    My mission is to help emerging leaders find “the way” for themselves, and then, take lead of “the way”, their way.
